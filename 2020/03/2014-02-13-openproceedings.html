<p>Github provides a great interface for gathering, peer reviewing and accepting papers for conference proceedings, the second step is to publish them on a website either in HTML or PDF form or both.
The Scipy conference is at the forefront on this and did great work in peer reviewing on Github, see: <a href="https://github.com/scipy-conference/scipy_proceedings/pull/61">https://github.com/scipy-conference/scipy_proceedings/pull/61</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted to develop a system to make it easier to continously publish updated versions of the papers and also leverage FigShare to provide a long term repository, a sharing interface and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">DOI</a>.</p>

<p>I based it on the blog engine <a href="http://getpelican.com"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Pelican</code></a>, developed a plugin <a href="http://github.com/openproceedings/pelican_figshare_pdf"><code class="highlighter-rouge">figshare_pdf</code></a> to upload a PDF of an article via API and configured <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis-ci</a> as building platform.</p>
